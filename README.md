# Note-Taker Application
### Description
This application was designed with the intention of providing the user with a means of efficiently creating, saving, and deleting notes on a local server. In launching this application on a localhost address, the user is presented with a clean interface that allows them to title their note, provide content, and save this note which will appear in a column on the left side, in the order in which they're created. Following this initial step, users are able to select their previously completed notes and choose to edit or delete notes from their local server.
